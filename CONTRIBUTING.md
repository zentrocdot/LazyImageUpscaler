# How to contribute to Lazy Image Upscaler

## Did you find a bug?

Ensure that the bug was not already reported by searching on <i>GitHub</i>
under <i>Issues</i>.

If you can not find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one.

Make sure that you include a title and a clear description, as much relevant
information as possible and an test case that shows the expected behaviour
that does not occur.

It is best to copy and paste an error message from the terminal window and
add this more or less detailed error message to the opened issue.
